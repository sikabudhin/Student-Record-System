# Student-Record-System

Hi there! 👋  
This is a simple web app I built to help **store and manage student records**. It's a great example of how websites talk to databases behind the scenes.

---

## 🧩 What it does:

- You can **fill out a form** to register student info
- The system **stores that data in a MySQL database**
- It then **displays all students** neatly in a table

---

## 🛠 How it works:

- **Frontend**: HTML & CSS – creates the layout and form
- **Backend**: PHP – handles data saving and fetching
- **Database**: MySQL – stores student data using Workbench

I used **XAMPP** to run the PHP and MySQL server locally.

---

## 📷 Example Use:

You can enter:
- Name
- Date of Birth
- Gender
- Email
- Phone Number

Click "Register" and — boom — it's stored in the database! You’ll instantly see the new record in the table below.

## 💻 Why I made it:

I'm learning full-stack development and wanted to build something practical — not just “Hello World”. This project helped me understand how forms, PHP, and MySQL all work together.
